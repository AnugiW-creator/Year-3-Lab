# Year-3-Lab


Does what it says on the tin.
This is coding for Year 3 lab. 

# Modules:

## Astronomical Image Processing:
        Identifies galaxies within CCD image provided in lab.

        Identifying sources 
        New_Identifying_sources 
        image_processing.py
        Histogram plotting.
        Necessary_code provides clean code need to identify potential galaxies, image_processing.py includes Gaussian plots used to determine background and Identifying sources and New_Identifying_sources only contain algorithm identifying clusters of pixels that could be sources. Histogram plotting includes only the code used to plot histograms of the pixel count for each suspected source.

## Solar Radiation
        Uses solar flux to calculate albedo of different surfaces, cloud depth and optical depth.
